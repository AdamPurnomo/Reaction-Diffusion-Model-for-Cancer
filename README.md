# Reaction-Diffusion-Model-for-Cancer
### Overview
A Python implementation of reaction-diffusion model simulation for invasive cancer. The model is based on this [study](https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/56/24/5745.full.pdf) [1]

The model is based on reaction and diffusion equation in which the cancer growth is facilitated by the diffusion of excess acid production from cancer cells to the surrounding healthy tissue
